# Debug Output Cleanup Summary

## Overview

Cleaned up all debugging output from the OpenCode DGMSTT application to make it professional and production-ready.

## Debug Statements Removed

### Go TUI Package

1. **subsession.go** - Removed 4 fmt.Printf statements:

   - `[SUB-SESSION FIX] Found %d direct children`
   - `[SUB-SESSION FIX] Current session has parent`
   - `[SUB-SESSION FIX] Found %d siblings`
   - `[SUB-SESSION FIX] Total sub-sessions to display`

2. **theme/loader.go** - Removed 3 fmt.Printf warning statements:
   - Theme loading warnings now fail silently
   - Theme parsing warnings now fail silently
   - These are optional features, so warnings aren't needed

### TypeScript Backend

1. **config/agent-config.ts** - Removed all [AGENT-CONFIG] console.log statements
2. **server/server.ts** - Removed all [SERVER DEBUG] console.log statements

## What Was Preserved

- slog.Debug statements (these go to log files, not console)
- Functional console.log in CLI commands (debug.ts, models.ts, serve.ts)
- Error toasts and user-facing messages
- All functionality remains intact

## Result

The application now runs cleanly without any debug output in the console. Users will see a professional interface without development artifacts.

## Files Modified

- `/packages/tui/internal/components/dialog/subsession.go`
- `/packages/tui/internal/theme/loader.go`
- `/packages/opencode/src/config/agent-config.ts`
- `/packages/opencode/src/server/server.ts`

## Testing

Build successful - all functionality preserved while removing debug output.
