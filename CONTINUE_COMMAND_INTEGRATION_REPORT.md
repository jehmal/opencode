# /continue Command Integration Report

## Executive Summary
Successfully completed end-to-end integration and validation of the DGMO /continue command with real-time WebSocket feedback. The system now provides seamless user experience with progress updates and automatic clipboard functionality.

## Integration Components Validated

### 1. WebSocket Connection (âœ… FIXED)
- **Issue Found**: Mutex deadlock in TaskClient.ConnectWithRetry() blocking connections
- **Root Cause**: Long-running server readiness checks holding mutex for up to 60 seconds
- **Solution Applied**: Removed mutex lock during I/O operations, only acquiring for state changes
- **Result**: Connection establishes immediately with proper event flow

### 2. Event Emission (âœ… VALIDATED)
- Server properly emits task events at /session/:id/continuation-prompt endpoint
- Events emitted: TaskStartedEvent, TaskProgressEvent (25%, 75%), TaskCompletedEvent
- Task ID format: `continuation-{sessionID}-{timestamp}`
- All events include proper metadata and timestamps

### 3. Real-time UI Updates (âœ… IMPLEMENTED)
- Added missing message type definitions: ContinuationPromptProgressMsg, ContinuationPromptCompletedMsg
- Connected WebSocket task events to UI progress updates
- Progress toasts display at 25% and 75% milestones
- Success toast shows completion statistics and clipboard confirmation

### 4. System Coordination (âœ… COMPLETE)
- Fixed clipboard/keybinds.go compilation errors (tea.KeyBinding â†’ key.Binding)
- Integrated task event handlers to detect continuation prompt tasks
- Proper toast ID management for progress updates
- Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages

## Test Results

### Performance Metrics
- âœ… Connection establishment: < 1 second
- âœ… Initial toast display: Immediate on command trigger
- âœ… Progress updates: Real-time at 25% and 75%
- âœ… Total completion time: < 5 seconds
- âœ… Clipboard functionality: Automatic copy on success

### User Experience Flow
1. User types `/continue` â†’ Initial toast appears immediately
2. WebSocket events flow â†’ Progress toasts update in real-time
3. Generation completes â†’ Success toast with statistics
4. Prompt copied to clipboard â†’ Ready for agent handoff

### Error Scenarios Tested
- âœ… Server unavailable: Clear error message displayed
- âœ… Network failure: Graceful degradation with error toast
- âœ… Invalid session: Appropriate error handling
- âœ… WebSocket disconnection: Automatic reconnection with retry logic

## Technical Implementation Details

### Key Files Modified
1. `/packages/tui/internal/app/task_client.go`
   - Fixed mutex deadlock in connection logic
   - Enhanced retry mechanism with exponential backoff
   - Added connection health monitoring

2. `/packages/tui/internal/tui/tui.go`
   - Added ContinuationPrompt message types
   - Integrated task event handlers for continuation prompts
   - Connected WebSocket events to UI updates

3. `/packages/tui/internal/components/clipboard/keybinds.go`
   - Fixed import issues (tea â†’ key package)
   - Maintained clipboard functionality

### Integration Architecture
```
User Input (/continue)
    â†“
TUI Command Handler
    â†“
HTTP Request â†’ Server Endpoint
    â†“
Task Events Emitted (WebSocket)
    â†“
TaskClient Receives Events
    â†“
UI Progress Updates (Toasts)
    â†“
Clipboard Copy on Success
```

## Success Criteria Achieved
1. âœ… User sees initial toast immediately
2. âœ… Progress updates visible at 25% and 75%
3. âœ… Completion notification with statistics
4. âœ… Automatic clipboard functionality
5. âœ… Clear error messages for failures
6. âœ… Complete process under 5 seconds
7. âœ… Real-time WebSocket indicators

## Known Issues & Future Enhancements
1. **Connection Status Bar**: While WebSocket status is tracked, visual indicator in status bar could be enhanced
2. **Progress Granularity**: Currently shows 25% and 75% - could add more granular updates
3. **Retry UI**: Connection retry attempts could show visual feedback
4. **History**: Continuation prompts could be stored for later retrieval

## Testing Instructions
1. Start server: `cd packages/opencode && bun run dev`
2. Build TUI: `cd packages/tui && go build ./cmd/dgmo`
3. Run test script: `./test_continue_command.sh`
4. Manual test: Run TUI and type `/continue`

## Deployment Checklist
- [x] WebSocket connection reliability verified
- [x] Event emission validated
- [x] UI updates working correctly
- [x] Error handling comprehensive
- [x] Performance metrics achieved
