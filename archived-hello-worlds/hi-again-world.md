# Hi Again, World!

Welcome back! If you've already said "Hello, World!", it's time for a friendly follow-up.

## A Warm Reunion

Sometimes, one greeting just isn't enough. "Hi again, World!" represents the continuation of your programming journey - because learning doesn't stop after the first hello.

## Simple Example

Here's how to greet the world again in Python:

```python
print("Hi again, World!")
```

It's that simple! Keep coding, keep learning, and keep saying hi to new possibilities.
