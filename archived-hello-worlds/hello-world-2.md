# Hello, World! Examples

A collection of "Hello, World!" programs in different programming languages.

## Python

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

**Explanation:** Python uses the `print()` function to display text to the console. It's known for its simple and readable syntax, making it an excellent choice for beginners.

## JavaScript

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!")
```

**Explanation:** JavaScript uses `console.log()` to output text to the console. This language is primarily used for web development and can run in browsers or Node.js environments.

## Java

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

**Explanation:** Java requires a class structure and a `main` method as the entry point. `System.out.println()` is used to print text. Java is a strongly-typed, object-oriented language commonly used for enterprise applications.

## C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:** C++ uses `std::cout` from the iostream library to output text. The `<<` operator sends the string to the output stream. C++ is a powerful systems programming language that provides low-level control.

## Ruby

```ruby
puts "Hello, World!"
```

**Explanation:** Ruby uses the `puts` method to print text with a newline. Like Python, Ruby emphasizes simplicity and readability, following the principle of "least surprise" in its design.
