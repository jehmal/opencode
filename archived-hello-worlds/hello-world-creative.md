# Hello World! 🌍

## A Cosmic Greeting

_In the beginning, there was void..._
_Then a programmer spoke: "Hello, World!"_
_And suddenly, pixels danced with joy,_
_Bits and bytes began to twirl._

_From silicon dreams to screens so bright,_
_These two words sparked digital light._
_A tradition born in '72,_
_When Kernighan showed us what to do._

## Greetings Around the Globe 🌏

### Fun Facts About How Different Cultures Say Hello:

**🇯🇵 Japan**: _Konnichiwa_ + a bow! The depth of your bow shows respect level:

- 15° for casual greetings
- 30° for respectful greetings
- 45° for apologies or meeting the emperor!

**🇳🇿 New Zealand**: The Māori _Hongi_ - pressing noses together to share the breath of life!

**🇹🇭 Thailand**: The _Wai_ - palms together like prayer, with a slight bow. The higher your hands, the more respect!

**🇰🇪 Kenya**: Maasai warriors greet by spitting at each other's feet (it's actually a blessing!)

**🇹🇷 Turkey**: Kissing both cheeks, but the number varies by region (1-4 kisses!)

**🇮🇳 India**: _Namaste_ means "I bow to the divine in you" - recognizing the soul in another person

**🇪🇸 Spain**: In some regions, it's two kisses starting with the right cheek. In others, it's left first. Choose wisely!

## The Philosophy of Hello World

Every programmer's journey begins with these two simple words. It's not just about printing text - it's a rite of passage, a first conversation between human and machine. In that moment when "Hello World" appears on your screen, you've crossed the threshold from user to creator.

Some say the tradition started with Brian Kernighan's 1972 tutorial for the B programming language. Others trace it to earlier roots. But regardless of origin, "Hello World" has become our universal first spell in the book of code magic.

## Bonus: Hello World Haiku

```
First program compiles
"Hello World" greets the cosmos
Coder smiles with pride
```

_Remember: Every expert was once a beginner who typed "Hello World" and felt the magic! 🚀_
