# OpenCode Sub-Session Navigation Fixes Summary

## Overview

Fixed two critical issues in the sub-session navigation feature:

1. **Ctrl+B navigation refresh issue** - Screen wasn't updating after navigation
2. **Sub-session filtering issue** - Dialog was showing ALL sub-sessions instead of filtered ones

## Fix 1: TUI Rendering After Navigation

### Problem

- Ctrl+B navigation worked (session switched correctly)
- But screen didn't update until terminal was resized
- Navigation state changed but UI didn't refresh

### Root Cause

The messages component wasn't handling `app.SessionSwitchedMsg`, so it didn't know to re-render when the session changed.

### Solution

Added handling for `SessionSwitchedMsg` in `messages.go`:

```go
case app.SessionSwitchedMsg:
    // Clear cache and reload when session switches
    m.cache.Clear()
    m.tail = true
    return m, m.Reload()
```

This follows the same pattern as `SessionSelectedMsg` and `SessionClearedMsg`.

## Fix 2: Sub-Session Filtering

### Problem

- Sub-session dialog showed ALL sub-sessions in the system
- Should only show children of current session and siblings

### Root Cause

The `NewSubSessionDialog` constructor had a fallback that loaded ALL sub-sessions when no direct children were found. This was overriding the more sophisticated filtering logic.

### Solution

Following the proven "sessions dialog" pattern:

1. Removed the fallback to all sub-sessions
2. Implemented proper filtering logic in the constructor (not Init)
3. Load data synchronously like the working sessions dialog

The constructor now:

- Gets direct children of current session
- If current session has a parent, also gets siblings
- Builds tree structure immediately
- No reliance on Init() method (which wasn't being called reliably)

## Engineering Decision Rationale

### Why Constructor Loading?

Based on the memory evidence and the working sessions dialog pattern:

- Bubble Tea doesn't reliably call Init() for modal dialogs
- The sessions dialog (which works perfectly) loads data in constructor
- Synchronous loading ensures data is ready when dialog appears
- No race conditions or timing issues

### Code Pattern Consistency

We now follow the same pattern as the rock-solid sessions dialog:

```go
func NewSubSessionDialog(app *app.App) SubSessionDialog {
    // Load data immediately
    // Filter and process
    // Set items in list
    // Return ready dialog
}

func (s *subSessionDialog) Init() tea.Cmd {
    return nil  // No async loading needed
}
```

## Testing Instructions

1. Build the TUI:

   ```bash
   cd packages/tui
   go build -o dgmo cmd/dgmo/main.go
   ```

2. Test sub-session filtering:

   - Create sub-sessions with task tool
   - Open /sub-session dialog
   - Should see ONLY relevant sub-sessions (not all)

3. Test Ctrl+B refresh:
   - Navigate to a sub-session
   - Press Ctrl+B to go back
   - Screen should update immediately (no resize needed)

## Files Modified

- `/packages/tui/internal/components/chat/messages.go` - Added SessionSwitchedMsg handler
- `/packages/tui/internal/components/dialog/subsession.go` - Implemented constructor loading pattern

## Lessons Learned

1. Always follow proven patterns in the codebase
2. Bubble Tea modal Init() is not reliable for data loading
3. Synchronous constructor loading is more predictable
4. The sessions dialog pattern is rock-solid and should be emulated
