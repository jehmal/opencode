# DGMO Parallel Agents Implementation Handoff Checklist

## âœ… Completed Work Verification

### TypeScript Implementation

- [x] **sub-session.ts** - AsyncGenerator fix applied, all methods implemented
- [x] **task.ts** - SubSession integration, auto-debug feature added
- [x] No TypeScript compilation errors in our code

### Go TUI Implementation

- [x] **command.go** - SubSessionCommand added to registry
- [x] **subsession.go** - Dialog created (needs SDK fixes)
- [x] **tui.go** - Command handler added
- [x] Commands compile without errors

### Documentation

- [x] **test-parallel-agents.md** - Comprehensive test scenarios
- [x] **PARALLEL_AGENTS_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md** - Current state documented
- [x] **CONTINUATION_DGMO_PARALLEL_AGENTS_FINAL.md** - Handoff prompt created

## ðŸ“‹ Handoff Summary

### What's Working

1. Sub-session storage with full CRUD operations
2. AsyncGenerator issue completely resolved
3. Task tool tracks sub-session lifecycle
4. Auto-debug on failures with smart retry
5. /sub-session command registered
6. Inline task display (existing functionality)

### What Needs Completion (25%)

1. **SDK Integration** - Fix imports in subsession.go
2. **WebSocket Events** - Real-time task updates
3. **Ctrl+B Navigation** - Return to parent session
4. **Testing Suite** - Automated tests for all features

### Key Technical Details

- Storage Path: `~/.opencode/session/sub-sessions/`
- Index Path: `~/.opencode/session/sub-session-index/`
- WebSocket Port: 5747 (if following existing pattern)
- Tool Filtering: Already fixed (checks parentID)

### Known Issues

1. subsession.go has SDK import issues
2. WebSocket infrastructure might already exist
3. Navigation needs session loading implementation

## ðŸš€ Ready for Handoff

The continuation prompt at `/CONTINUATION_DGMO_PARALLEL_AGENTS_FINAL.md` contains:

- Complete context and file locations
- 4 parallel sub-agent tasks
- Memory search queries for context recovery
- Known issues with solutions
- Success criteria and testing approach

The next agent can immediately start with the memory searches and launch the 4 sub-agents to complete the remaining 25% of the implementation.
