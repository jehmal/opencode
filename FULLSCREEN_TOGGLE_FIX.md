# Fullscreen Toggle Fix for Bubble Tea TUI

## Problem Summary

The fullscreen toggle feature had two main issues:

1. **Logic Inversion**: The app started with `tea.WithAltScreen()` but `isFullscreen` was `false`, causing the toast messages to be inverted (showing "disabled" when actually in fullscreen).

2. **Commands Not Working**: The screen mode didn't actually change when toggling because the commands weren't being executed properly.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: State Mismatch

- The app initializes with `tea.WithAltScreen()` in main.go (line 81)
- This means the app starts in alternate screen mode
- But `isFullscreen` was initialized to `false` (default value)
- This caused the logic to be inverted

### Issue 2: Command Execution

- The code was creating functions that return messages: `func() tea.Msg { return tea.EnterAltScreen() }`
- But Bubble Tea provides these as direct commands: `tea.EnterAltScreen` and `tea.ExitAltScreen`
- The indirect approach wasn't working as expected

## Solution

### 1. Renamed Variable for Clarity

Changed `isFullscreen` to `isAltScreen` to better reflect what it actually tracks:

```go
isAltScreen bool // Track alternate screen state
```

### 2. Fixed Initial State

Set the initial state to match the actual screen mode:

```go
isAltScreen: true, // Start with alt screen enabled (matches tea.WithAltScreen())
```

### 3. Fixed Command Execution

Use the commands directly instead of wrapping them:

```go
// Before (not working):
cmd = func() tea.Msg { return tea.EnterAltScreen() }

// After (working):
cmd = tea.EnterAltScreen
```

### 4. Updated Toast Messages

The toast messages now correctly reflect the state:

- When `isAltScreen` is true → "Fullscreen mode enabled"
- When `isAltScreen` is false → "Fullscreen mode disabled"

## Complete Fix

```go
// Handle alternate screen toggle (Shift+Tab)
if keyString == "shift+tab" {
    a.isAltScreen = !a.isAltScreen
    var cmd tea.Cmd
    if a.isAltScreen {
        cmd = tea.EnterAltScreen
    } else {
        cmd = tea.ExitAltScreen
    }
    // Show toast notification for user feedback
    toastMsg := "Fullscreen mode enabled"
    if !a.isAltScreen {
        toastMsg = "Fullscreen mode disabled"
    }
    return a, tea.Batch(cmd, toast.NewInfoToast(toastMsg))
}
```

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the fix:

```bash
./test-fullscreen-toggle.sh
```

Expected behavior:

1. App starts in alternate screen mode (fullscreen)
2. Press Shift+Tab → Shows "Fullscreen mode disabled" and exits to normal screen
3. Press Shift+Tab again → Shows "Fullscreen mode enabled" and returns to alternate screen
4. Screen mode actually changes each time
5. All other functionality continues to work normally

## Key Learnings

1. **State must match reality**: Always ensure your state variables reflect the actual state of the system
2. **Use framework APIs correctly**: Bubble Tea provides commands as functions, not as messages to be wrapped
3. **Clear naming prevents confusion**: `isAltScreen` is clearer than `isFullscreen` for what we're actually tracking
4. **Test the actual behavior**: Don't just check if the code compiles - verify the screen actually changes
