# IMPORTANT: Server Restart Required

## The Fix is Implemented - You Need to Restart

Based on your screenshot, I can see that:

1. `parentId` is an empty string `""`
2. `isMainSession` is returning `false`
3. Session mode is `"all-tools"`
4. But task tool is still being filtered out

## What I've Fixed

1. **Updated `isSubAgentSession`** to check for empty strings:

   ```typescript
   return (
     parentId !== undefined &&
     parentId !== null &&
     parentId !== "" &&
     parentId !== "undefined"
   )
   ```

2. **Added comprehensive logging** to trace the issue

3. **Verified the logic** - it's working correctly in tests

## Action Required

**You must restart the OpenCode server for the changes to take effect:**

1. **Stop the current session** (Ctrl+C or close the terminal)

2. **Start a fresh session**:

   ```bash
   dgmo run
   ```

3. **Test again**:
   - Create a task: "Create 3 agents to analyze this code"
   - Check the console output - you should now see:
     - `isMainSession: true` (not false)
     - No `[SESSION] Tool filtered out: task` message
   - Check `/sub-session` - agents should appear

## Why This Will Work

The screenshot shows the OLD code is still running. The fix checks for empty string parentId, which is exactly what you have. Once you restart:

- Empty string `""` will be treated as "no parent"
- `isMainSession` will return `true`
- Task tool will be available
- Sub-sessions will be created

## If It Still Doesn't Work After Restart

Check the console for the new logging:

- `[AGENT-CONFIG] Main session detected, returning ALL_TOOLS including task`
- `[AGENT-CONFIG] Returning tools: 13 tools, includes task: true`
- `[AGENT-CONFIG] isToolAllowed for task: { ... isAllowed: true ... }`

The fix is complete - you just need to restart the server!
