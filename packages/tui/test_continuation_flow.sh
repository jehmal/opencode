# Test script to verify continuation prompt flow behavior

echo "Testing Continuation Prompt Flow Fix"
echo "===================================="
echo ""
echo "This test verifies that:"
echo "1. /continue command triggers prompt generation"
echo "2. Task ID is tracked from server response"
echo "3. New session is created only after TaskCompletedMsg"
echo "4. Progress events are properly associated with sessions"
echo ""
echo "Expected flow:"
echo "- User types /continue"
echo "- Server starts generation (task.started event)"
echo "- Progress events show during generation"
echo "- Server completes (task.completed event)"
echo "- Only THEN new session is created"
echo ""
echo "Key changes made:"
echo "1. Added continuationTaskID and continuationPrompt to appModel"
echo "2. ContinuationPromptCommand stores task ID, doesn't create session"
echo "3. TaskCompletedMsg handler checks for continuation task ID"
echo "4. Session creation moved to task completion"
echo ""
echo "To test manually:"
echo "1. Start a session and have some conversation"
echo "2. Type /continue"
echo "3. Watch for progress toasts"
echo "4. Verify new session is created AFTER generation completes"
echo "5. Check that progress events don't appear in the new session"
