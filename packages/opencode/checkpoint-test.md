# An Open Letter to Grapes

Dear Grapes,

I'm writing to express my utter disappointment in your existence. You masquerade as nature's candy, but you're just water balloons with delusions of grandeur. Your seeds are sneaky little surprises that ruin perfectly good bites, and don't even get me started on your wrinkled alter ego, the raisin - the ultimate betrayal of fruit expectations.

You cluster together like you're plotting something, hanging around in bunches like some kind of fruit gang. And what's with the multiple personalities? Green, red, purple - pick a color and stick with it! You're the indecisive fruit that can't commit.

Sincerely frustrated,
A Former Grape Tolerator
