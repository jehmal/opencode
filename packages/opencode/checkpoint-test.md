OFFICIAL GRAPE STATEMENT:
"We've been VINE all along! 🍷 Your accusations are GRAPE-ly exaggerated. We're not water balloons - we're JUICE EXECUTIVES. Our seeds? That's called JOB SECURITY. Raisins? That's our RETIREMENT PLAN. Multiple colors? It's called DIVERSITY, sweetie. 💅

P.S. - At least we're not bananas. Those guys are literally going extinct from being too perfect. 🍌💀"
