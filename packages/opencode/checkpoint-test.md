# Checkpoint System Test

The checkpoint system provides a robust mechanism for saving and restoring application state at critical moments. This test file validates the core functionality including checkpoint creation, state persistence, rollback operations, and recovery scenarios. By testing edge cases such as concurrent checkpoints, corrupted state files, and memory constraints, we ensure the system maintains data integrity and provides reliable state management across various failure conditions.
