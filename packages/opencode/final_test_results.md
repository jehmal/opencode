# /continue Command Fix Test Results

## Summary
The fix for the `/continue` command bug has been successfuly implemented. The command now generates **session-specific continuation prompts** instead of using cached/hardcoded defaults.

## What Was Fixed

### Before
- All sessions would generate the same hardcoded prompt mentioning "opencode AI coding assistant development"
- Continuation prompts were not analyzing the actual session content
- Same prompt regardless of what was discussed in the session

### After  
- Each session generates a unique continuation prompt
- The prompt analyzes the actual messages in the current session
- Content is extracted from the conversation (files, topics, errors)
- No more hardcoded defaults

## Technical Changes

1. **Added Session Analysis Function** (`analyzeSessionMessages`)
   - Extracts mentioned file paths using regex
   - Identifies discussed topics and tasks
   - Finds errors and issues from conversation
   - Builds dynamic project state

2. **Modified Continuation Endpoint**
   - Gets actual session messages using `Session.messages(sessionID)`
   - Analyzes messages to understand context
   - Generates prompt based on real session content
   - Uses extracted data instead of hardcoded values

## Test Results

### Automated Testing
- ✅ Created multiple test sessions with different topics
- ✅ Each session generated a unique continuation prompt
- ✅ No hardcoded "opencode" defaults found
- ✅ Prompts are different for each session (verified)

### Session-Specific Content
While the prompts are now unique to each session, the content extraction can be further improved. Currently:
- Session titles are used as project names
- Basic topic extraction is working
- File path extraction is functional
- Error detection is implemented

## Verification Steps

To verify the fix is working:

1. Start DGMO TUI
2. Create a session discussing topic A (e.g., "Help with REST API")
3. Run `/continue` - note the generated prompt
4. Create a new session (`/new`) 
5. Discuss topic B (e.g., "Debug WebSocket issues")
6. Run `/continue` - verify it's different from step 3
7. The prompts should reflect the different topics discussed

## Code Location
- Main fix: `/packages/opencode/src/server/server.ts`
- Function: `analyzeSessionMessages()` 
- Endpoint: `/session/:id/continuation-prompt`

## Future Improvements
While the core bug is fixed, the content extraction could be enhanced:
- Better topic extraction algorithms
- More sophisticated file path detection
- Deeper analysis of conversation intent
- Integration with vector memory for richer context
