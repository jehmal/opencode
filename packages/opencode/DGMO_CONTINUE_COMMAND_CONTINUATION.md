# DGMO /continue Command Implementation - Continuation Prompt

## Instructions for Next DGMO Agent

You are continuing the implementation of the DGMO /continue slash command. The project is 75% complete with Go compilation issues resolved and server endpoints working. Your task is to fix the WebSocket communication system so users see real-time progress updates during continuation prompt generation.

## Project Context

**Working Directory:** `/mnt/c/Users/jehma/Desktop/AI/DGMSTT/opencode/packages/opencode`
**Key Repositories:**

- `/mnt/c/Users/jehma/Desktop/AI/DGMSTT/opencode/packages/tui` - Go TUI client
- `/mnt/c/Users/jehma/Desktop/AI/DGMSTT/opencode/packages/opencode` - TypeScript server
  **Architecture:** WebSocket-based real-time communication between TypeScript server and Go TUI client

## Memory Search Commands

First, retrieve the current project state and patterns:

```
Search: "DGMO continue command WebSocket implementation project snapshot"

- `packages/tui/internal/tui/tui.go:783-857` - Command handler and UI updates
- `packages/tui/internal/components/status/status.go` - Status display component

**Build/Test:**

- `packages/tui/cmd/dgmo/main.go` - Entry point (fmt import added)
- `packages/opencode/package.json` - Server dependencies and scripts

## Required Tasks (USE 4 SUB-AGENTS IN PARALLEL)

### Sub-Agent 1: WebSocket Connection Diagnostics

**Task:** Debug and fix WebSocket client connection establishment

**Implementation Details:**

1. Analyze `task_client.go` WebSocket connection logic
2. Verify connection URL format and server endpoint matching
3. Test actual connection establishment with logging
4. Fix any connection timeout or handshake issues
5. Ensure proper error handling and reconnection logic

**Expected Output:** Working WebSocket connection between TUI client and server
**Location:** `packages/tui/internal/app/task_client.go`
**Dependencies:** WebSocket server running on correct port

### Sub-Agent 2: Event Emission Validation

**Task:** Verify and fix server→client event flow

**Implementation Details:**

1. Trace event emission in `server.ts` continue endpoint
2. Verify event types match between server emission and client handling
3. Test event payload structure and serialization
4. Debug event routing through task-events system
5. Ensure events reach WebSocket clients properly

**Expected Output:** Server events successfully reaching TUI client
**Location:** `packages/opencode/src/server/server.ts` and `packages/opencode/src/events/`
**Dependencies:** WebSocket connection established

### Sub-Agent 3: Real-Time UI Updates

**Task:** Implement progress tracking and notification system

**Implementation Details:**

1. Fix toast notification system for progress updates
2. Implement "Task progress: 25%" → "Task progress: 75%" display
3. Add completion notification with success message
4. Implement clipboard copy functionality with statistics
5. Add real-time connection status indicators

**Expected Output:** User sees visible progress feedback throughout process
**Location:** `packages/tui/internal/tui/tui.go` and status components
**Dependencies:** Events flowing from server to client

### Sub-Agent 4: Integration Testing & Coordination

**Task:** End-to-end validation and system coordination

**Implementation Details:**

1. Test complete workflow: command → server → events → UI updates
2. Validate timing: process completes under 5 seconds
3. Test error scenarios and graceful degradation
4. Coordinate fixes from other agents
5. Perform final integration testing

**Expected Output:** Complete working /continue command with real-time feedback
**Location:** Full system integration
**Dependencies:** All other agents' fixes implemented

## Integration Requirements

- **Event Type Consistency:** Server emission types must match client handler expectations
- **WebSocket Protocol:** Ensure proper WebSocket handshake and message format
- **UI Thread Safety:** TUI updates must be thread-safe for real-time events
- **Error Propagation:** Failed operations should show clear error messages to user

## Technical Constraints

- **Go TUI Framework:** Must work with existing Bubble Tea architecture
- **TypeScript Server:** Maintain compatibility with existing server structure
- **WebSocket Library:** Use established WebSocket libraries (gorilla/websocket for Go)
- **Performance:** Complete workflow under 5 seconds
- **User Experience:** No silent failures - always provide feedback

## Success Criteria

1. **User sees initial toast:** "Generating continuation prompt..." appears immediately
2. **Progress updates visible:** "Task progress: 25%" and "Task progress: 75%" display
3. **Completion notification:** "Continuation prompt generated successfully" with statistics
4. **Clipboard functionality:** Prompt automatically copied to clipboard
5. **Error handling:** Clear error messages for any failures
6. **Performance:** Complete process under 5 seconds
7. **Connection status:** Real-time WebSocket connection indicators

## Testing Approach

After implementation:

1. **Unit Test:** `bun test` - Verify no regressions in existing tests
2. **Compilation Test:** `cd packages/tui && go build ./cmd/dgmo` - Ensure Go builds
3. **Server Test:** Start server and verify WebSocket endpoint responds
4. **Integration Test:** Run `/continue` command and observe real-time updates
5. **Performance Test:** Measure end-to-end timing under 5 seconds
6. **Error Test:** Test with server down, network issues, invalid inputs

## Known Issues & Solutions

**Issue:** `math.Rand undefined` compilation error
**Solution:** ✅ RESOLVED - Added `math/rand` import, changed to `rand.Float64()`

**Issue:** `lipgloss.Color is not a type` compilation error  
**Solution:** ✅ RESOLVED - Used type inference with theme function initialization

**Issue:** `fmt undefined` compilation error
**Solution:** ✅ RESOLVED - Added `fmt` import to main.go

**Issue:** `StatusComponent interface panic`
**Solution:** ✅ RESOLVED - Changed all methods to pointer receivers

**Issue:** WebSocket events not reaching TUI client
**Solution:** ❌ NEEDS ATTENTION - Focus of current implementation

## Important Notes

- **Systematic Approach:** Use ReAct framework with Chain of Thought reasoning that successfully resolved compilation issues
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Server emits events, client receives and updates UI in real-time
- **User Experience Priority:** Visible progress feedback is essential - no silent operations
- **WebSocket Reliability:** Implement proper connection handling, timeouts, and reconnection logic
- **Thread Safety:** TUI updates from WebSocket events must be properly synchronized

**Remember:** The compilation issues were systematically resolved using structured debugging. Apply the same methodical approach to the WebSocket communication system.

## Start Instructions

1. **Begin with memory searches** to understand current state and previous solutions
2. **Launch 4 parallel sub-agents** using the task breakdown above
3. **Focus on WebSocket communication** as the core issue blocking user experience
4. **Test incrementally** - verify each component works before integration
5. **Prioritize user feedback** - ensure visible progress throughout the process

Start by searching memory for the mentioned queries to restore full context, then launch your sub-agents to complete the WebSocket communication implementation. The goal is a seamless user experience with real-time progress updates during continuation prompt generation.
