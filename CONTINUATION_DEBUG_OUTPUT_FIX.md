# Instructions for Next OpenCode DGMSTT Debug Output Fix Agent

You are continuing the debugging of persistent console output in OpenCode DGMSTT. The project is 90% complete with all functionality working, but debug messages still appear in the console despite multiple removal attempts. Your task is to completely eliminate ALL debug output from the TUI.

## Project Context

- Working Directory: `/mnt/c/Users/jehma/Desktop/AI/DGMSTT/opencode`
- Key Repositories:
  - Backend: `/packages/opencode` (TypeScript/Bun)
  - Frontend: `/packages/tui` (Go/Bubble Tea)
- Architecture Doc: See memory snapshots
- Related Systems: slog logging, console output, TUI/backend interaction

## Memory Search Commands

First, retrieve the current project state and patterns:

1. Search: "PROJECT SNAPSHOT OpenCode DGMSTT Debug Output Persistence Issue"
2. Search: "OpenCode DGMSTT Complete Debug Cleanup Final"
3. Search: "slog configuration console output TUI"
4. Search: "dgmo binary multiple locations debug"
5. Search: "Bubble Tea console output stderr inherit"

## Completed Components (DO NOT RECREATE)

✅ Removed all fmt.Printf debug statements from Go code
✅ Removed all slog.Debug with [SUB-SESSION] and [NAV] prefixes
✅ Removed all console.log debug statements from TypeScript
✅ Fixed nil pointer in SendChatMessage (added a.Session == nil check)
✅ Fixed syntax errors in server.ts (escaped quotes)
✅ Changed slog level from Debug to Info
✅ Added null logger at startup to discard early messages
✅ Removed unused imports and cleaned up code

## Critical Files to Reference

1. Logging Configuration:

   - `/packages/tui/cmd/dgmo/main.go` - slog setup with io.Discard
   - Lines 26-51: Logger initialization

2. Multiple Binary Locations:

   - `/home/jehma/.local/bin/dgmo` - System dgmo script
   - `./dgmo` - Root directory binary
   - `./packages/tui/dgmo` - Built TUI binary
   - `./packages/tui/cmd/dgmo/dgmo` - Another location

3. Backend Launch:
   - `/packages/opencode/src/cli/cmd/tui.ts` - How TUI is launched
   - Lines 68-84: Spawn with stdout/stderr inherited

## Required Tasks (USE 4 SUB-AGENTS IN PARALLEL)

### Sub-Agent 1: Binary Investigation

Determine which dgmo binary is actually being executed and why old code might still be running

- Check if embedded binary in Bun has old code
- Verify which binary the backend launches
- Check for cached binaries
- Trace exact execution path
  Location: All dgmo binary locations
  Dependencies: File system access, process tracing

### Sub-Agent 2: slog Output Investigation

Find why slog messages appear in console despite file-only configuration

- Check if there's a default console handler
- Look for any slog setup before main.go
- Investigate if backend is capturing and outputting logs
- Check for any middleware affecting output
  Location: `/packages/tui` and slog configuration
  Dependencies: Go logging knowledge

### Sub-Agent 3: Backend Process Investigation

Analyze how the TypeScript backend launches and communicates with TUI

- Check if backend is intercepting TUI output
- Investigate stdout/stderr inheritance
- Look for any logging proxies
- Check if backend has its own debug output
  Location: `/packages/opencode/src/cli/cmd/tui.ts`
  Dependencies: Process spawning, stream handling

### Sub-Agent 4: Alternative Solution Implementation

Implement a guaranteed solution to suppress all output

- Create wrapper script that redirects all output
- Or modify TUI launch to redirect stdout/stderr
- Or find and fix the actual source
- Test thoroughly
  Location: Launch scripts and configuration
  Dependencies: Results from other agents

## Integration Requirements

1. Solution must not affect functionality
2. Error messages should still reach log files
3. User-facing messages (toasts) must work
4. No performance impact
5. Cross-platform compatibility (Windows/WSL/Linux)

## Technical Constraints

- slog is Go's structured logging library
- Bubble Tea TUI framework may have its own output
- Backend uses Bun.spawn with inherited streams
- Multiple binaries complicate debugging
- Debug messages show [NAV] and other prefixes

## Success Criteria

1. Zero debug output in console
2. dgmo runs completely clean
3. All functionality preserved
4. Errors still logged to files
5. No regression in features
6. Solution works across all platforms
7. No temporary files or output
8. Professional appearance
9. Permanent fix (not workaround)
10. Clear documentation of root cause

## Testing Approach

After implementation:

1. Start fresh terminal
2. Run dgmo without backend running
3. Run dgmo with backend running
4. Send messages and navigate
5. Use /sub-session command
6. Test Ctrl+B navigation
7. Check for ANY console output
8. Verify log files still work
9. Test on different platforms
10. Ensure clean professional UI

## Known Issues & Solutions

- Issue: Multiple removal attempts haven't worked
  Solution: Need to find actual source, not just remove calls
- Issue: slog configured for file but outputs to console
  Solution: May need to redirect at process level
- Issue: Multiple binaries exist
  Solution: Ensure all are updated or correct one is used

## Important Notes

- User is frustrated with persistent debug output
- This is the final cleanup task
- Must be 100% effective
- Previous attempts removed code but output persists
- Consider that output might be from compiled binary
- Backend launches TUI with inherited streams
- Remember: Professional, clean UI is the goal

Start by searching memory for the mentioned queries to understand the current state, then launch your sub-agents to investigate and fix this issue permanently. The debug output MUST be completely eliminated.
