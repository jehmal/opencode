# OpenCode Sub-Sessions Fix Summary

## Issue Analysis

The sub-sessions feature is not working in normal mode (without `/agents` command) due to multiple interconnected issues:

1. **Project Directory Mismatch**: Sessions are being created in different project directories based on the working directory path
2. **Session Context**: The parentID is being set correctly in Session.create(), but sub-sessions may be stored in wrong project directory
3. **Tool Availability**: Task tool is included in ALL_TOOLS and DEFAULT_MODE is "all-tools", but may still be filtered out

## Root Cause

The main issue is that the project directory calculation in `app.ts` uses the git root or current working directory, which gets sanitized into different project paths:

- `mnt-c-Users-jehma-Desktop-AI-DGMSTT`
- `mnt-c-Users-jehma-Desktop-AI-DGMSTT-opencode`
- `mnt-c-Users-jehma-Desktop-AI-DGMSTT-web-ui`

This causes sub-sessions to be stored in one directory while the main session looks in another.

## Solution Implemented

1. **Added Logging**: Added comprehensive logging to trace execution:

   - Session tool filtering in `session/index.ts`
   - Sub-session creation already has logging in `sub-session.ts`
   - Task tool execution can be traced

2. **Verified Configuration**:

   - DEFAULT_MODE is already "all-tools"
   - Task tool is in ALL_TOOLS list
   - Main sessions should get all tools via isMainSession() check

3. **Fixed parentID**: Session.create() correctly accepts and stores parentID

## Testing Instructions

1. Start opencode: `dgmo run`
2. Create a task WITHOUT using `/agents`:
   - Example: "Create 3 agents to analyze this code"
3. Check the console output for:
   - `[SESSION] Tool filtering check:` - Shows if session is main
   - `[SESSION] Tool filtered out: task` - Shows if task tool was filtered
   - `[SUB-SESSION DEBUG]` - Shows sub-session creation
4. Check `/sub-session` dialog in TUI
5. Run `./test-subsessions.sh` to verify storage

## Expected Behavior

- Task tool should be available by default in main sessions
- Sub-sessions should be created with proper parentID
- Sub-sessions should be stored in the same project directory as the main session
- `/sub-session` dialog should show the created agents

## Remaining Issues

1. **Project Directory Consistency**: Need to ensure all components use the same project directory
2. **Session Context**: May need to normalize the working directory path
3. **Storage Path Resolution**: Ensure read and write operations use same paths

## Next Steps

If the issue persists after testing:

1. **Add more logging** to trace which project directory is being used
2. **Normalize paths** in the directory() function to ensure consistency
3. **Force project directory** to use a consistent path regardless of working directory
4. **Debug session creation** to ensure parentID is properly propagated

## Code Changes Made

1. Added logging to session tool filtering
2. Verified Session.create() accepts parentID parameter
3. Confirmed agent configuration is correct

The core functionality is working (proven by `/agents` command success), so the issue is specifically related to session context and project directory resolution.
