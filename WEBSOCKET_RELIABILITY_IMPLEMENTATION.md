# WebSocket Connection Reliability Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive set of WebSocket connection reliability fixes following a hierarchical approach. All three levels of fixes have been completed and tested.

## Implementation Summary

### LEVEL 1: Connection Establishment Fixes ✅ COMPLETED

#### 1. Exponential Backoff Retry Logic

- **File**: `packages/tui/internal/app/task_client.go`
- **Implementation**: Added `calculateBackoffDelay()` method with configurable retry parameters
- **Features**:
  - Configurable max retries (default: 10)
  - Base delay: 1 second, max delay: 30 seconds
  - Backoff factor: 2.0 with jitter to prevent thundering herd
  - Graceful handling of context cancellation

#### 2. Connection Health Checks and Heartbeat Mechanism

- **Implementation**: Added heartbeat tracking and connection health monitoring
- **Features**:
  - `updateHeartbeat()` and `getLastHeartbeat()` methods
  - `isConnectionHealthy()` with 60-second timeout
  - Heartbeat events properly handled in `readLoop()`
  - Connection timeout management with read deadlines

#### 3. Server Readiness Checks

- **Implementation**: Added `isServerReady()` method
- **Features**:
  - TCP connection test before WebSocket upgrade
  - 30-second startup wait period for first connection
  - Prevents unnecessary connection attempts to unavailable server

#### 4. Connection State Management

- **Implementation**: Added atomic state management with `ConnectionState` enum
- **States**: `Disconnected`, `Connecting`, `Connected`, `Reconnecting`, `Failed`
- **Features**:
  - Thread-safe state transitions
  - State change notifications via callback handlers
  - Comprehensive connection statistics via `GetConnectionStats()`

### LEVEL 2: Error Handling Enhancement ✅ COMPLETED

#### 1. Enhanced Error Reporting

- **Implementation**: Improved error context and logging throughout connection lifecycle
- **Features**:
  - Detailed error messages with context
  - Proper error propagation to UI layer
  - Structured logging with connection state information

#### 2. UI Feedback for Connection Status

- **Files**:

  - `packages/tui/cmd/dgmo/main.go` - Status handler setup
  - `packages/tui/internal/app/app.go` - ConnectionStatusMsg type
  - `packages/tui/internal/tui/tui.go` - Message handling
  - `packages/tui/internal/components/status/status.go` - Visual indicators

- **Features**:
  - Toast notifications for connection state changes
  - Visual connection status indicator in status bar
  - Color-coded connection health (green=connected, yellow=connecting, red=failed)
  - Real-time status updates

#### 3. Graceful Degradation

- **Implementation**: Application continues to function when WebSocket fails
- **Features**:
  - Non-blocking connection attempts in background
  - Application startup not dependent on WebSocket connection
  - Task progress gracefully disabled when disconnected
  - User informed of reduced functionality

#### 4. Connection Status Indicators

- **Implementation**: Visual indicators in status bar
- **Symbols**:
  - `●` (solid) - Connected (green) or Failed (red)
  - `◐` (half) - Connecting/Reconnecting (yellow)
  - `○` (empty) - Disconnected (gray)

### LEVEL 3: Event Flow Robustness ✅ COMPLETED

#### 1. Event Acknowledgment System

- **Implementation**: Heartbeat-based acknowledgment system
- **Features**:
  - Server heartbeat events properly acknowledged
  - Connection health based on heartbeat timing
  - Automatic reconnection when heartbeat fails

#### 2. Event Queuing for Disconnected Periods

- **Implementation**: Added `eventQueue` with thread-safe operations
- **Features**:
  - Events queued when connection is not in `Connected` state
  - Queue size limit (1000 events) to prevent memory issues
  - Thread-safe queue operations with mutex protection

#### 3. Event Replay Mechanism

- **Implementation**: `processQueuedEvents()` method
- **Features**:
  - Automatic replay of queued events upon reconnection
  - Events processed in order they were received
  - Queue cleared after successful processing

## Key Technical Improvements

### Connection Reliability

1. **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with jitter prevents connection storms
2. **Health Monitoring**: Continuous health checks ensure connection quality
3. **State Management**: Atomic state transitions provide consistent behavior
4. **Server Readiness**: Prevents wasted connection attempts

### Error Handling

1. **Comprehensive Logging**: Structured logging at all connection stages
2. **User Feedback**: Real-time status updates via UI components
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Application remains functional during outages
4. **Error Context**: Detailed error information for debugging

### Event Processing

1. **Queue Management**: Events preserved during disconnections
2. **Replay System**: No event loss during connection interruptions
3. **Thread Safety**: All operations properly synchronized
4. **Memory Management**: Queue size limits prevent resource exhaustion

## Files Modified

### Core Connection Logic

- `packages/tui/internal/app/task_client.go` - Main TaskClient implementation
- `packages/tui/internal/websocket/task_client.go` - Base WebSocket client

### UI Integration

- `packages/tui/cmd/dgmo/main.go` - Connection status handler setup
- `packages/tui/internal/app/app.go` - Message type definitions

## Configuration Options

### RetryConfig Structure

```go
type RetryConfig struct {
    MaxRetries      int           // Default: 10
    BaseDelay       time.Duration // Default: 1 second
    MaxDelay        time.Duration // Default: 30 seconds
    BackoffFactor   float64       // Default: 2.0
    JitterEnabled   bool          // Default: true
    ServerCheckURL  string        // Default: "http://localhost:5747/health"
}
```

### Connection States

- `StateDisconnected` - No connection
- `StateConnecting` - Initial connection attempt
- `StateConnected` - Active connection
- `StateReconnecting` - Attempting to reconnect
- `StateFailed` - Connection failed after all retries

## Testing Approach

### Automated Testing

- Connection state transitions
- Retry logic verification
- Event queuing and replay
- Error handling scenarios
- UI feedback mechanisms

### Manual Testing Scenarios

1. **Server Unavailable**: Start client before server
2. **Connection Loss**: Disconnect network during operation
3. **Server Restart**: Restart server while client connected
4. **High Load**: Multiple rapid connection attempts
5. **Extended Downtime**: Long-term server unavailability

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Management

- Event queue size limited to 1000 events
- Automatic cleanup of completed tasks after 30 seconds
- Efficient connection state tracking with atomic operations

### CPU Usage

- Non-blocking connection attempts
- Efficient retry scheduling
- Minimal overhead for health checks

### Network Efficiency

- Jittered retry delays prevent thundering herd
- Server readiness checks reduce unnecessary attempts
- Proper connection cleanup prevents resource leaks

## Monitoring and Observability

### Connection Statistics

```go
stats := client.GetConnectionStats()
// Returns:
// - state: Current connection state
// - retry_count: Number of retry attempts
// - queue_size: Number of queued events
// - last_heartbeat: Timestamp of last heartbeat
// - is_healthy: Boolean health status
// - url: WebSocket URL
```

### Logging

- Structured logging with connection context
- State transition logging
- Error logging with full context
- Performance metrics logging

## Success Metrics
