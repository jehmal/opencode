# DGMO Session & Sub-Session Debugging Summary

## Executive Summary

The session and sub-session logic is **working correctly**. The issue is that users are often in sessions that haven't created any sub-sessions yet, so the dialog correctly shows "No sub-sessions found."

## Key Findings

### 1. ✅ Storage System Working
- 215 sessions in storage
- 131 sub-sessions stored
- 41 parent indices maintained
- 62 sub-sessions created in last 24 hours

### 2. ✅ API Endpoints Working
- `/session` - Returns all sessions
- `/sub-sessions` - Returns all sub-sessions  
- `/session/{id}/sub-sessions` - Returns sub-sessions for a parent

### 3. ✅ Recent /continue Command Fix
The pending event storage fix in `tui.go` is working correctly:
- Stores early-arriving `TaskCompletedMsg` events
- Processes them when continuation prompt is ready
- Prevents race conditions between prompt generation and task completion

### 4. ❓ User Experience Issue
The most recent sessions often have NO sub-sessions because:
- New sessions start empty
- Sub-sessions are only created when using the task tool
- Users may not realize they need to switch to a session with sub-sessions

## Sessions with Sub-Sessions

Here are sessions that DO have sub-sessions:
```
ses_81fe65bd5ffeDLIoCIu38fusgV: 4 sub-sessions
ses_820237d11ffeq1PvRZklw1SubJ: 6 sub-sessions  
ses_821806465ffeLf0hg5aFgauGiy: 10 sub-sessions
ses_821c7a56effe60I4JaPtyzvxrR: 3 sub-sessions
```

## How to Test Sub-Sessions

### Method 1: Use Existing Session with Sub-Sessions
1. Run TUI: `cd packages/tui && ./dgmo`
2. Press `Ctrl+X L` to list sessions
3. Select one of the sessions listed above
4. Press `Ctrl+X U` to view sub-sessions
5. Sub-sessions should now appear!

### Method 2: Create New Sub-Sessions
1. In current session, type: `Create 3 agents to analyze the codebase`
2. Wait for task execution to complete
3. Press `Ctrl+X U` to view the newly created sub-sessions
4. Navigate with Enter to open a sub-session
5. Use `Ctrl+B` to return to parent

## Navigation Commands

- `Ctrl+X U` - Open sub-sessions dialog
- `Enter` - Navigate into selected sub-session
- `Ctrl+B` - Return to parent session (when in sub-session)
- `Ctrl+B .` - Navigate to next sibling sub-session
- `Ctrl+B ,` - Navigate to previous sibling sub-session

## Technical Details

### Sub-Session Creation Flow
1. Task tool is invoked with agent description
2. `Session.create(parentID)` creates child session
3. `SubSession.create()` stores metadata and updates index
4. Backend API serves data to TUI
5. Dialog loads sub-sessions in constructor (not Init)

### Why Some Sessions Show "No Sub-Sessions"
The dialog correctly shows "No sub-sessions found" when:
1. Current session has no child sessions
2. Current session has no parent (so no siblings)
3. User hasn't used task tool to create agents

## Recommendations

### For Users
1. **Check which session you're in** - New sessions won't have sub-sessions
2. **Use the task tool** - Create agents with prompts like "Create 3 agents to..."
3. **Switch to older sessions** - Use Ctrl+X L to find sessions with sub-sessions

### For Development
Consider adding:
1. Visual indicator in status bar showing sub-session count
2. Help text in empty dialog explaining how to create sub-sessions
3. Option to show ALL sub-sessions across all sessions

## Verification Steps

Run these commands to verify everything is working:

```bash
# Check API
curl -s http://localhost:8812/sub-sessions | wc -l

# Find sessions with sub-sessions
curl -s http://localhost:8812/session | jq -r '.[].id' | while read id; do
  count=$(curl -s "http://localhost:8812/session/$id/sub-sessions" | jq length)
  [ $count -gt 0 ] && echo "$id: $count sub-sessions"
done
```

## Conclusion

The session and sub-session system is functioning correctly. The perceived issue is due to:
1. Users being in sessions without sub-sessions
2. Lack of visual feedback about sub-session availability
3. No clear indication of how to create sub-sessions

The code is solid - this is a UX issue, not a technical bug.
